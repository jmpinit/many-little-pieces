<h2>PUT NAME HERE</h2>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">IMAGINE</span> <br />
a top-down 2D ascii world where you had to work for all the symbols you used in programming.<br />
You have to <i>mine</i> each and every chararacter you use. Mine through the endless world of symbols, desperately searching for the very important "}" you need to finish the function to finish your robot of ultimate DESTRUCTION!<br />
<br />
Thats right: Robots <i><b>YOU</b></i> program in javascript<br />
<br />
Only a baisic api guide is availible, everything else you have to reverse-engineer from monster-robs you've killed.<br />
<br />
Kill a boss, get the code! Now you know EXACTLY how to get extended range weapons!<br />
