<p>What if  you had to work for all the symbols you used in programming.
You have to <i>mine</i> each and every chararacter you use. Mine through the endless world of symbols, desperately searching for the very important "}" you need to finish the function to finish your robot of ultimate DESTRUCTION!

Thats right: Robots <i><b>YOU</b></i> program in javascript

Only a baisic api guide is availible, everything else you have to reverse-engineer from monster-robs you've killed.

Kill a boss, get the code! Now you know EXACTLY how to get extended range weapons!
